    "# Filtering and Downloading Scenes as a GeoPackage\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will use the catalog download resource to get the GeoPackage schema, then to discover pages of published scenes from which we will populate an in-memory GeoPackage collection using [fiona](https://github.com/Toblerity/Fiona), and finally we will download the populated GeoPackage. See the [GeoPackage download API documentation](https://api.carbonmapper.org/api/v1/docs#/Data%20Catalog/catalog_api_scene_scenes_download_gpkg).\n",
    "\n",
    "The resource provides the `intersects` parameter, which accepts a feature's GeoJSON geometry and will filter for scenes that intersect the provided geometry. Our GeoJSON is a simplified representation of the state of California. Note that there is an 8,192 byte API URL size limit for requests, hence the simplified GeoJSON. We will also provide a 3-year date range for our query. Because the endpoint is paginated, the `count` returned may differ from the length of the `items` returned."
