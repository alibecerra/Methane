abstract = {The environmental community rightly recognizes global warming as one of the gravest threats to the planet. Methane (CH4), one of the greenhouse gases causing global warming, is emitted from a variety of sources and its concentration in atmosphere has increased dramatically over the last few centuries. Therefore, the increasing concentrations of methane are of special concern because of its effects on climate and atmospheric chemistry. Anthropogenic sources of methane can be collected under the titles of agriculture, energy, waste and industry on the basis of sectors. This paper aims at examining the past trends in emissions, the sources and mitigation strategies of the methane. As a result of the study, it is determined that the agricultural sector is the biggest source of methane emissions among the sectors. The energy, waste and industry follow the agricultural sources respectively.}
